# Determinatic

## What is this

This is essentially a modular version of [autumn](https://github.com/nluqo/autumn/).

Written in TS 🤤.

```bash
npm install determinatic
```

Then import it into your project and use it.

```js

const determinatic = determinatic({
  /* options */
});

determinatic.getColor("my-seed"); //#d2b50a
```
